            <p>The Journey Checker was developed by Nutbolt as a way of quickly and easily checking if there were any delays on his journey home from work</p>
            <p>It grew to allow more flexibility, allowing users to select their own tube lines etc...</p>
            <p>The London Underground data is provided by TfL and is updated every 30 seconds</p>
            <p>The Home page will update itself every 32 seconds to display the most recent data. The way it updates means you won't notice unless a lines status changes</p>
